    <p>It is situated on a mountain ridge above the Sacred Valley which is 80
    kilometres (50 mi) northwest of Cuzco and through which the Urubamba River
    flows.  Most archaeologists believe that Machu Picchu was built as an estate
    for the Inca emperor Pachacuti (1438â€“1472). Often mistakenly referred to as
    the Lost City of the Incas, it is the most familiar icon of Inca
    civilization.</p>

    <p>The Incas built the estate around 1450, but abandoned it a century later
    at the time of the Spanish Conquest. Although known locally, it was not
    known to the Spanish during the colonial period and remained unknown to the
    outside world before being brought to international attention in 1911 by the
    American historian Hiram Bingham. Most of the outlying buildings have been
    reconstructed in order to give tourists a better idea of what the structures
    originally looked like. By 1976, 30% of Machu Picchu had been restored;
    restoration continues today.</p>

    <p>Machu Picchu was declared a Peruvian Historical Sanctuary in 1981 and a
    UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1983. In 2007, Machu Picchu was voted one of
    the New Seven Wonders of the World in a worldwide Internet poll.</p>
